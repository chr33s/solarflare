## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities to active maintainers with reproducible steps and clear impact assessment. We will create a GitHub security advisory to coordinate disclosure and may invite you to collaborate.

## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service degradation
- Only access accounts they own or have explicit permission to test
- Report any PII encountered immediately and purge local copies
- Allow reasonable time to resolve issues before public disclosure

We will not pursue legal action for research conducted under this policy and will assist if a third party does. Submit a report before engaging in conduct not covered here.
